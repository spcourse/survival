# Survival

When you're programming on your own projects you won't have the guidance that you have grown accustomed to during this course. Until now, the questions that you needed to solve were quite confined and the information you needed was all available on the website. Some of the questions in this exercise will be more open-ended. And one of the challenges is to find the information you need to answer the question yourself.

You will inspect and analyze data from different fields of biology, and use that information to answer questions about the data. We're more interested in steps you took to answer the questions than the answers themselves.

The module consists of two parts. First you will learn how to use a library called `Pandas` to read and manipulate data. Then you will learn to use `Seaborn` to inspect and analyze data. All further reading is contained within the notebooks of the exercises.
