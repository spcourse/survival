# Pandas

Learn to store and manipulate data using Python's `pandas` library. All exercises and information are contained in the notebook:  [download](../downloads/pandas.zip)

This assignment is in the form of a Jupyter notebook. This is another type of programming environment that runs directly in the browser. Jupyter notebooks allow you to interactively write code, which can be very practical when working with data.

To run the Jupyter notebook for this exercise: in your terminal, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the assignment files. Type:

    jupyter notebooks

This should open a new tab in your default internet browser, showing a sort of navigator. Click on the notebook file called `pandas.ipynb`. This will open a new tab showing the contents of the notebook. Follow the instructions there on how to use notebooks.
